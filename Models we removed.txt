We considered using linear regression which gave us an acceptable R-squared score of 0.16 but 
we dropped this model because ridge regression was a significant imporvement probably because the
basic linear model was overfitting the data.

We also considered using polynomial regression but this only gave us a good correlation between 
IMDB rating and total number of votes and there didn't seem to be a strong quadratic relationship 
with any other features. Additionally we attempted to apply the ridge method to the polynomial 
regression to see if it would help as it did with the linear model but there was little imporvement 
and all of the polynomial models had poor R-squared scores. As discussed we decided to drop total 
number of votes and the polynomial models were not useful after that.
